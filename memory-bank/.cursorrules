## YAML & CMS Patterns

- When adding a list of objects (e.g., services) to markdown frontmatter for CMS editing, always use block style YAML for nested fields in config.yml.
- Never use inline object notation (curly braces) for nested fields in YAML. Only use block style for lists/objects under `fields:`.
- This prevents YAML semantic errors and ensures Netlify CMS (and similar) compatibility.
- Apply this pattern for all future list/object fields in CMS config.

## Example (Correct):

      - label: "Services"
        name: "services"
        widget: "list"
        fields:
          - label: "Name"
            name: "name"
            widget: "string"
          - label: "Description"
            name: "description"
            widget: "text"
          - label: "Price"
            name: "price"
            widget: "string"

## Example (Incorrect):

      - {label: "Services", name: "services", widget: "list", fields: [ ... ]}

## Rationale

- Block style is required for nested fields due to YAML parsing rules and CMS expectations.
- Inline object notation is only safe for top-level fields, not for nested lists/objects.
