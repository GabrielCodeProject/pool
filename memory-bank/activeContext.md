# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Improving documentation and Memory Bank completeness.
- Ensuring all project context and progress is accurately captured for future resets.

## Recent Changes

- Homepage UI/UX refactored with Shadcn UI components.
- Netlify Functions for backend logic are robust and CORS-compliant.
- Memory Bank initialized and updated with projectbrief.md, progress.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md.

## Next Steps

- Optionally enhance admin authentication (e.g., GitHub OAuth, user management UI).
- Add more content types or richer markdown features if needed.
- Continue updating Memory Bank as project evolves.

## Active Decisions

- Continue using static export for Next.js and Netlify Functions for all dynamic logic.
- Prioritize clear, user-friendly admin UI and safe content editing workflows.
