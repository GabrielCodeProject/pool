# Progress

## What Works

- Homepage UI/UX refactored to use Shadcn UI components (Card, Skeleton, Alert, Typography) for a modern, user-friendly experience.
- Admin panel allows editing of markdown content (with live preview and safe frontmatter editing).
- Netlify Functions handle all backend logic (list, read, update markdown), with robust CORS and preflight support.
- Environment variable and deployment issues resolved.
- Memory Bank initialized with projectbrief.md.

## What's Left to Build

- Add more Memory Bank files for full documentation (productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md).
- Optional: Enhance admin authentication (e.g., GitHub OAuth, user management UI).
- Optional: Add more content types or richer markdown features.

## Current Status

- Static site and backend are working as intended.
- All major cross-origin, API, and UI issues resolved.

## Known Issues

- None blocking at this time.
