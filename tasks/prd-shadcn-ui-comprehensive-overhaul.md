# Product Requirements Document: Shadcn/ui Comprehensive Overhaul

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive overhaul of the existing shadcn/ui implementation in the pool services Next.js application. The project aims to enhance visual design aesthetics, fix existing bugs, improve design consistency, and redesign the application with a complete shadcn/ui component suite to create a modern, cohesive user experience.

Currently, the application uses 8 shadcn/ui components with a solid foundation, but lacks comprehensive navigation, interactive elements, and has design inconsistencies including a critical typography bug where the H2 component renders as an H1 element.

## Goals

1. **Enhance Visual Design**: Improve overall aesthetics through better typography hierarchy, spacing consistency, and modern design patterns
2. **Fix Critical Bugs**: Resolve the typography H2 component bug and any other existing issues
3. **Improve Design Consistency**: Standardize spacing, colors, variants, and component patterns throughout the application
4. **Implement Complete Component Suite**: Add comprehensive navigation, interactive elements, and display components
5. **Create Modern User Experience**: Enhance service exploration, visual appeal, and mobile responsiveness

- Browse services on mobile with an optimized, responsive design

**As a business owner, I want to:**
- Present services in a professional, consistent visual hierarchy

8.2. Add filtering and sorting capabilities with Select components
8.3. Implement service detail views with Dialog/Modal patterns
8.4. Create comparison interfaces for different service packages

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Backend API development or data structure changes
- Content management system modifications
- SEO implementation changes (existing SEO structure is maintained)
- E-commerce or payment integration features
- Multi-language support implementation
- Authentication or user account systems
- Third-party service integrations (booking systems, CRM, etc.)

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design Principles
- **Consistency**: All components follow the established "new-york" shadcn/ui style variant
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all interactive elements
- **Brand Alignment**: Maintain existing color scheme and brand identity
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Clean, minimal design with appropriate use of whitespace

### Component Usage Guidelines
- **Navigation**: Use NavigationMenu for main navigation, Tabs for content organization
- **Content Organization**: Accordion for expandable content, Tabs for category switching
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Badge for status/categories, proper typography scale
- **Interactive Elements**: Consistent button variants, proper form controls

### Responsive Design Requirements
- **Mobile-First**: All components designed for mobile experience first
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: Tailwind's responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile interactions
- **Navigation Patterns**: Collapsible mobile navigation, appropriate spacing

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Approach
- **Shadcn/ui MCP Server**: Utilize jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server for component implementation
- **Existing Configuration**: Build on current components.json configuration
- **TypeScript Integration**: Maintain strict TypeScript compliance
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Leverage latest Tailwind features and design tokens

### Component Dependencies
- **Existing Components**: Build upon current Button, Card, Carousel implementations
- **New Dependencies**: May require additional Radix UI primitives
- **CSS Variables**: Extend existing OKLCH color system as needed
- **Icon Library**: Continue using Lucide React for consistency

### Performance Considerations
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor impact of additional components on build size
- **Tree Shaking**: Ensure unused component code is eliminated
- **Loading Performance**: Implement progressive loading for complex components
- **Static Export**: Maintain compatibility with Next.js static export

## Open Questions

1. **Component Priority Phases**: Should the implementation be divided into phases, and if so, what's the preferred order?

2. **Custom vs Standard Components**: For components like ImageSeo, should they be refactored to use shadcn/ui patterns or maintained as custom implementations?

3. **Animation Preferences**: What level of animations and transitions are desired for the new interactive elements?

4. **Content Integration**: How should the new navigation and organizational components integrate with the existing markdown-based content system?

5. **Testing Strategy**: What testing approach should be used to validate the new component implementations?

6. **Accessibility Requirements**: Are there specific accessibility requirements beyond WCAG 2.1 AA compliance?

7. **Browser Support**: What browsers and versions need to be supported for the enhanced component suite?

8. **Performance Budgets**: Are there specific performance constraints or budgets to consider for the additional components?
